colonize_uriankhai_desc;After the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border by the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), the Qing inexplicably placed border guards south of the Tannu-ola Mountains separating Tannu Uriankhai from Outer Mongolia, not along the Sayan Mountains separating the region from Russia. During the 19th century, Russians began to settle in Tuva. The Qing Dynasty allowed Russians to settle providing that they lived in boats or tents. This historical basis and the Russian population living there provides us with an excuse to add the territory of Tannu Tuva to the Russian borders, and the founding of a new Russian city will only strengthen our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
