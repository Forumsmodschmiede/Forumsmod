Luederitz has plans to send expeditions further north, in the place the natives call Otjozondjii, known in German as Swakopmund but under the belief that a Great Power was about to claim the area as a protectorate, Luederitz stalled his plans and asked for the protection of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government in $YEAR$. Extending our protection to him and hoisting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag in Luederitzbucht, declaring these lands "protection areas" can start the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ South West Africa Colony, though we risk some attrition with other Great Powers..;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
