the_totalitarian_regime_desc;We must finish once and for all with the neutrality of chess. We must condemn once and for all the formula 'chess for the sake of chess', like the formula 'art for art's sake'. We must organize shock brigades of chess-players, and begin immediate realization of a Five-Year Plan for chess. Our nation took all the necessary steps and the framework for a new kind of political system, a political system in which the state holds total authority over the society and seeks to control all aspects of public and private life wherever possible.
